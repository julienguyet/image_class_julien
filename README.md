# Basic to Complex Image Classification

---

## 1. Modeling :telescope:

The notebook for the MNIST dataset is available in the [mnist_julien_guyet](https://github.com/julienguyet/image_class_julien/blob/main/mnist_julien_guyet.ipynb) notebook. 

The [cnn.py](https://github.com/julienguyet/image_class_julien/blob/main/cnn.py) file contains the pipeline with (i) the CNN model I designed in MNIST dataset and (ii) a plot functions.

Finally, the [dogs_breeds_julien_guyet](https://github.com/julienguyet/image_class_julien/blob/main/dogs_breeds_julien_guyet.ipynb) notebook contains the code for the dog breed classification task.

Here is a screenshot of the challenged solved (also attached when submitting the assignment):

## 3. Self Assessment :monocle_face:

- Documentation: 15 - 18 >>> Explanations and comments are added for all parts of the project. 
- Modelization: 18 - 20 >>> Different models were tested for both tasks, with Logistic Regression as a baseline. A pipeline was designed for easy use of the home made CNN model.
- Performances: ~50 >>> Comparaisons are done with proper plots and comments. I also tried to improve my model step by step and did some research on how to do so. However, I am not sure all conclusions or investigations are correct.
- Bonus: 10
